            <h4>STAGE 1: HOMEOWNER FALLS BEHIND IN
PAYMENTS</h4>
            <p>It may be a loss of a job, or a
cut in your pay rate. Perhaps you have just
gone through a divorce, or had a major
medical concern. Whatever the reason is,
you have fallen behind on your mortgage
payments. When this happens, often times
homeowners are put in the no-win situation
of paying all their other bills, or paying their
mortgage. There is really no “right” answer to
this question, because whichever bill doesn’t
get paid has the possibility of leading to
negative consequences. If it is the Mortgage
that doesn’t get paid, the Bank will begin
contacting you to fi nd out when you will
make your missed payments. Homeowners
often will ignore these calls, because they
know they cannot make the payment in the
foreseeable future. Perhaps you are able to
make some payments, so you are always a
month or two behind. Eventually, you fall
behind to the point that the Bank is ready to
threaten you with foreclosure.</p>

            <h4>STAGE 2 : THE 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE
NOTICE</h4>
            <p>The timing of when you will receive
a 90-Day Pre-Foreclosure Notice varies from
case to case, but typically if you fall 30 or
more days behind you will likely receive
this letter. Under New York State law, this
letter is required to be sent to you. The Bank
must wait at least 90 days from sending this
letter before they begin a foreclosure action
against you. This 90-day window gives you
the opportunity to try to work with the Bank
to fi nd an alternative to foreclosure. This
notice must tell you how much you must
pay to bring your loan current. It must also
provide the names and telephone numbers
of at least 5 not-for-profit housing counseling
agencies serving your county.<i> A sample 90-day notice letter can be found below.</i></p>
<br />
<p>If you are reading this, you most likely
have already received this notice. If you have
recently received this letter, we strongly urge
you to do one of two things: (1) <a href="#">Contact a
local housing counseling agency</a> and make
an appointment to meet with them, as they
can help you through the process of working
with the Bank without any cost to you; or
(2) If you choose not to utilize the services of
a housing counseling agency, contact your
Bank directly. The longer you wait to work
with your Bank, the harder it will be for you to
keep your home!</p>

            <h4>STAGE 3: THE DEMAND LETTER</h4>
            <p>The timing of when you will receive a
“Demand Letter” depends on the language
in your Mortgage, but typically this will
occur when you are 45 to 60 days behind on
payments. Although the Bank is threatening
to begin a foreclosure proceeding if you
do not pay and may even say that you are
in foreclosure when you contact them, at
this point they have not actually filed any
documents with the Court.</p>
<br />
<p>
It is important to note that you may receive
a Demand Letter, even if you have contacted
the Bank and have begun to work with them
in trying to work out a plan to get current.
You may have sent lots of documents to
the Bank, which they are actively reviewing.
Regardless of these eff orts, you still may
receive a Demand Letter. With many large
banks, the Demand Letter is automatically
generated when you fall behind by a certain
amount of time on payments. Therefore,
even if you are being reviewed for workout
solutions, you still will receive the Demand
Letter. It does not mean that the Bank
has stopped reviewing your documents.
Therefore, if the Bank has asked you for more
documents, send them in – do not assume
that process has ended. <i>A sample of the demand letter can be found below.</i></p>

            <h4>STAGE 4: SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT</h4>
            <p>The Summons and Complaint is what tells
you that a lawsuit has been started. The
Summons and Complaint are created by the
Bank’s attorneys, and throughout them you
will be referred to as the Defendant. The
Summons is usually one of the fi rst pages,
and tells you some basic information about
the lawsuit that has been started. It will tell
you the name of the entity that has fi led the
foreclosure against you. This may simply be
the name of your Bank.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="row">
            <div class="small-8 columns">
            <p>However, the name of the party suing you
may be a long, confusing name that does
not sound familiar to you. For example, you
may see that the Plaintiff is “MORTGAGE
SERVICING AMERICA, AS TRUSTEE FOR
MORTGAGE INDEX 2005-RD4, MORTGAGE
PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2005-
RD4 UNDER THE POOLING AND SERVIING
AGREEMENT DATED DECEMEBER 1, 2005.”
The example of a Summons that follows this
section shows an example of one of these
types of trusts.</p>

        <br /><div class="row">
            <div class="small-12 columns">
            <p>The reason this sometimes happens is that your Bank may have taken your mortgage,
bundled it with hundreds of others, and
sold them on Wall Street. If that was the
case, they created a “Trust” (which is a type
of legal entity) that holds all the mortgages.
Therefore, when a foreclosure is fi led it has to
be the Trust that actually is the Plaintiff.</p>

            <div class="small-12 columns">
            <p>The Complaint tells you and the Court the
reasons the Bank is suing you and what they
are asking the Court to do. Because this is
a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have
not made your monthly payments as you
promised in your Mortgage and Note. When
you signed your Mortgage you put your
house up as collateral, in case you could not
pay the amount you borrowed. Now that you
have fallen behind on your payments (also
known as “defaulting”), the Bank is asking the
Court to enforce the terms of the Mortgage.
Terms of the Mortgage typically allow the
Bank to sell your house if you default on your
payments to them.</p>

            <div class="small-8 columns">
            <p>When you receive the Summons and
Complaint, you should also receive a notice
that again informs you that help is available
through a housing counseling agency. This
notice will be on a diff erent colored paper,
and in larger font. It should list all the HUDapproved
housing counseling agencies listed
in the folder of this guidebook. If you have
not contacted a housing counseling agency
at this point, we once again STRONGLY urge
you to contact one of them and make an
appointment to talk to a counselor.</p>

            <div class="small-12 columns">
            <p>It is important to note that you may receive
a Summons and Complaint even if you have
begun working with a housing counseling
agency or with the Bank directly. You may
be working with the Bank’s “loss mitigation”
department, which is the group that works
with struggling homeowners to come up with
a plan that allows you to keep your home.
You may have sent in multiple rounds of
documents to the Bank, and may be hopeful
that a solution to your problem is just around
the corner.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="small-8 columns">
            <p>However, most large banks have a completely
separate department that deals with fi ling
foreclosures. Therefore, even if you are in
the process of working with the Bank, the
Bank still may start a foreclosure against you.
If that is the case, do not despair. You can
continue to work with the Bank throughout
the foreclosure proceeding. So if they have
asked for more documents, or have told
you they are reviewing your file, you should
continue this process!</p>

            <p>Once you receive the Summons and

attorney, and by the Court. Important notices

to you, and it is critical that you be aware of
these developments.<i> Samples of Summons and Complaint below.</i></p>

            <h4>STAGE 5 (OPTIONAL): FILING AN ANSWER OR
NOTICE OF APPEARANCE</h4>
            <p>Once you receive
the Summons and Complaint you can fi le
an “Answer” or a “Notice of Appearance”. If
you were personally served the Summons
and Complaint (typically done by a “process
server”, who is a 3rd party that is hired by the
Bank’s attorneys to deliver legal documents),
you have 20 days to fi le an Answer. If the
Summons and Complaint were left on your
door, you should also receive a copy in the
mail. If this method of delivery is used, you
have 30 days to file an Answer.</p>

            <p>An Answer is a written response to the
Complaint. It does not HAVE to be fi led
by you – it is optional. You typically would
fi le an Answer only if you have legal claims
against the Bank. If you simply fell behind
on payments and were not able to catch up,
fi ling an Answer is often not necessary. An
Answer typically contains a paragraph-byparagraph
response to each paragraph in the
Complaint.</p>

Counterclaims are simply legal claims you
have against the Bank. The Answer is where
you can tell the Court any ways that you think
the Bank may have violated your rights. If you
have claims against the Bank and you do not
fi le an Answer, you may be waiving your right
